### How Does the Internet Work?

1. A **client** (any hardware that can connect to the internet) sends a *request* to a server. 

  Each client has a unique **IP address**.

2. Thanks to a network of cables connected via **routers**, the request moves towards its destination (the server) to retrieve information. Each time it goes through a different router, the signal gets a new layer of the IP address of the router so it can find its way back to the client once it reaches the server.

3. The server retrieves the request and **sends back** the answer (website, email, data,...) thanks to a chain of IP addresses.
